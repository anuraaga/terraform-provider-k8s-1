## metadata

Standard object metadata. metadata.Name indicates the name of the CSI driver that this object refers to; it MUST be the same name returned by the CSI GetPluginName() call for that driver. The driver name must be 63 characters or less, beginning and ending with an alphanumeric character ([a-z0-9A-Z]) with dashes (-), dots (.), and alphanumerics between. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/api-conventions.md#metadata

    
#### annotations

######  TypeMap

Annotations is an unstructured key value map stored with a resource that may be set by external tools to store and retrieve arbitrary metadata. They are not queryable and should be preserved when modifying objects. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/annotations
#### creation_timestamp

######  ReadOnly • TypeString

CreationTimestamp is a timestamp representing the server time when this object was created. It is not guaranteed to be set in happens-before order across separate operations. Clients may not set this value. It is represented in RFC3339 form and is in UTC.

Populated by the system. Read-only. Null for lists. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/api-conventions.md#metadata
#### deletion_grace_period_seconds

######  ReadOnly • TypeInt

Number of seconds allowed for this object to gracefully terminate before it will be removed from the system. Only set when deletionTimestamp is also set. May only be shortened. Read-only.
#### deletion_timestamp

######  ReadOnly • TypeString

DeletionTimestamp is RFC 3339 date and time at which this resource will be deleted. This field is set by the server when a graceful deletion is requested by the user, and is not directly settable by a client. The resource is expected to be deleted (no longer visible from resource lists, and not reachable by name) after the time in this field, once the finalizers list is empty. As long as the finalizers list contains items, deletion is blocked. Once the deletionTimestamp is set, this value may not be unset or be set further into the future, although it may be shortened or the resource may be deleted prior to this time. For example, a user may request that a pod is deleted in 30 seconds. The Kubelet will react by sending a graceful termination signal to the containers in the pod. After that 30 seconds, the Kubelet will send a hard termination signal (SIGKILL) to the container and after cleanup, remove the pod from the API. In the presence of network partitions, this object may still exist after this timestamp, until an administrator or automated process can determine the resource is fully terminated. If not set, graceful deletion of the object has not been requested.

Populated by the system when a graceful deletion is requested. Read-only. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/api-conventions.md#metadata
#### labels

######  TypeMap

Map of string keys and values that can be used to organize and categorize (scope and select) objects. May match selectors of replication controllers and services. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/labels
## managed_fields

ManagedFields maps workflow-id and version to the set of fields that are managed by that workflow. This is mostly for internal housekeeping, and users typically shouldn't need to set or understand this field. A workflow can be the user's name, a controller's name, or the name of a specific apply path like "ci-cd". The set of fields is always in the version that the workflow used when modifying the object.

This field is alpha and can be changed or removed without notice.

    
#### api_version

######  TypeString

APIVersion defines the version of this resource that this field set applies to. The format is "group/version" just like the top-level APIVersion field. It is necessary to track the version of a field set because it cannot be automatically converted.
#### fields

######  TypeMap

Fields identifies a set of fields.
#### manager

######  TypeString

Manager is an identifier of the workflow managing these fields.
#### operation

######  TypeString

Operation is the type of operation which lead to this ManagedFieldsEntry being created. The only valid values for this field are 'Apply' and 'Update'.
#### time

######  TypeString

Time is timestamp of when these fields were set. It should always be empty if Operation is 'Apply'
#### name

######  TypeString

Name must be unique within a namespace. Is required when creating resources, although some resources may allow a client to request the generation of an appropriate name automatically. Name is primarily intended for creation idempotence and configuration definition. Cannot be updated. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/identifiers#names
#### namespace

######  TypeString

Namespace defines the space within each name must be unique. An empty namespace is equivalent to the "default" namespace, but "default" is the canonical representation. Not all objects are required to be scoped to a namespace - the value of this field for those objects will be empty.

Must be a DNS_LABEL. Cannot be updated. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/namespaces
#### self_link

######  ReadOnly • TypeString

SelfLink is a URL representing this object. Populated by the system. Read-only.
#### uid

######  ReadOnly • TypeString

UID is the unique in time and space value for this object. It is typically generated by the server on successful creation of a resource and is not allowed to change on PUT operations.

Populated by the system. Read-only. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/identifiers#uids
## spec

Specification of the CSI Driver.

    
#### attach_required

######  TypeBool

attachRequired indicates this CSI volume driver requires an attach operation (because it implements the CSI ControllerPublishVolume() method), and that the Kubernetes attach detach controller should call the attach volume interface which checks the volumeattachment status and waits until the volume is attached before proceeding to mounting. The CSI external-attacher coordinates with CSI volume driver and updates the volumeattachment status when the attach operation is complete. If the CSIDriverRegistry feature gate is enabled and the value is specified to false, the attach operation will be skipped. Otherwise the attach operation will be called.
#### pod_info_onmount

######  TypeBool

If set to true, podInfoOnMount indicates this CSI volume driver requires additional pod information (like podName, podUID, etc.) during mount operations. If set to false, pod information will not be passed on mount. Default is false. The CSI driver specifies podInfoOnMount as part of driver deployment. If true, Kubelet will pass pod information as VolumeContext in the CSI NodePublishVolume() calls. The CSI driver is responsible for parsing and validating the information passed in as VolumeContext. The following VolumeConext will be passed if podInfoOnMount is set to true. This list might grow, but the prefix will be used. "csi.storage.k8s.io/pod.name": pod.Name "csi.storage.k8s.io/pod.namespace": pod.Namespace "csi.storage.k8s.io/pod.uid": string(pod.UID)
